**Software Engineer | Frontend Architect**

I am a Peruvian-based Software Engineer 🇵🇪 dedicated to building scalable, accessible, and business-driven digital products. With a background as a **UX Engineer** and **Frontend**, I bridge the gap between design, backend infrastructure, and business objectives.

### 🚀 Business Impact & Strategic Value
* **Driving User Engagement:** Led UI/UX initiatives specifically designed to increase the adoption of existing features, directly adding value to the product and business model.
* **Efficiency at Scale:** Established monorepo architectures and development standards that significantly reduced lead-times for new features and designs.
* **Enterprise Stability:** Contributed to large-scale projects building complex document systems and evaluated proprietary component libraries to ensure product stability and consistent user experiences.
* **Operational Excellence:** Optimized internal workflows by unifying and standardizing projects, which eliminated code duplication and ensured cross-compliance with design systems.
